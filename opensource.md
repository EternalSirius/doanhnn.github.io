### UNIC-CASS Program [[Link](https://unic-cass.github.io)]

This cool website is a good start for hardware-design beginners. It introduces both the analog and digital design flow using the opensoure tools and the Skywater 130nm PDK.

### EDAS Tool Example [[Link](https://github.com/EternalSirius/EDAS-Tool-Examples)]

This is my tutorial created when I was a master student. The tutorial shows a simple hardware example of a detector Finite-State Machine from RTL to GDS using Cadence and Synopsys Design Flow.

### Hugging Face [[Link](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)]

This is a good start for an AI learner in LLM. They support state-of-the-art pretrained models for inference and training.

### RISC-V

This is a kind of advance opensources. Only for who loves to build their own RISC-V based CPU. 

#### Chipyard [[Link](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard)]

#### Pulpissimo [[Link](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpissimo)]

#### Pulpino [[Link](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpino)]

### ImageNet Dataset Extraction [[Link](https://gist.github.com/BIGBALLON/8a71d225eff18d88e469e6ea9b39cef4)]

This is a cool script that I found out on Github. I did have a trouble with the ImageNet dataset's structure at first, but this script saves me a lot of time.

### Spiking Neural Network [[Link](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic)]

This is a good opensource that collects a lot of frameworks for SNN.

### Powerlevel10k [[Link](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)]

A customized theme for Zsh.
